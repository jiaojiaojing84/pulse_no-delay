# pulse_no-delay

This document is the simulation of pomp codes for the pulse that happens exactly at the first observation of Daphnia shows up every year. 
MIF2 is used for mle, output includes parameter estimate, the log likelihood value and the AIC in this model. 

fitparamsnull is the point estimate of parameters under MIF2 mle;
out.rda is the file that contains the values of fitparamsnull;
params is the file that has initial parameter values;

Daphnia_1.R is the R code that includes the main model and pomp function;
zoopmif_testrun.R is the one used to find mle under MIF2.
